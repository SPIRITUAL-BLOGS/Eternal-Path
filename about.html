  <h1>About This Platform</h1>
  <p>Preserving the wisdom of the eternal Sanātana tradition.</p>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <br>

  <p>
  This website is a humble spiritual initiative dedicated to documenting and
  sharing the lives, teachings, and divine presence of great spiritual masters
  of Sanātana Dharma.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
  In an age of noise and distraction, the timeless wisdom of realized beings
  continues to guide sincere seekers toward truth, discipline, and inner
  transformation. This platform aims to preserve and present that wisdom with
  authenticity and reverence.
  </p>

  <br><br>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <br>

  <p>
  The long-term vision of this platform is to create a structured spiritual
  knowledge space where readers can explore the lives of saints, philosophical
  insights, and reflections on Dharma, all presented in a calm and contemplative
  manner.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
  It is not intended as a commercial blog, but as a sacred digital space for
  learning, reflection, and inspiration.
  </p>

  <br><br>

  <h2>Dedication</h2>
  <br>

  <p>
  This work is offered with gratitude and reverence to the great Rishis, Gurus,
  and realized beings whose lives illuminate the path of humanity.
  </p>

  <br><br>

  <p style="font-style:italic;">
  “May knowledge arise.  
  May Dharma flourish.  
  May all beings walk toward light.”
